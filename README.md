"# Project3-grocerylist" 

* The project is about a grocery list the program will read and show the user the item name and quantity.
* I did pretty well in the do-while loop where the user can choose to 4 choices until the user exits the loop.
  It also has a try-catch function printing out a message when the user inputs a wrong number.
  
* The thing I can improve on is learning more data structures to use better methods of storing data.
 The previous chapter about linked lists and pointers make me realize that I need to know more about C++.

* The most challenging part of this project is how to store the list of items in a set.
  The reason is it's my first time using a set and pointer in a project.

* The skills I can transfer to other projects and use in my next projects are pointers and writing a new file.

* I made the code more readable by following the code guidelines provided in the announcement. 
  I also used more relatable and understandable variables and functions.
